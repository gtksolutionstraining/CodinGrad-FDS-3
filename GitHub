Repository: Its a Project
Public Repositories and Private Repositories, Open Source Repositories
Every Repository will have Licensing MIT License, Apacahe License, No License

--> Public is accessible for everyone
--> Private can have limited accessible
--> Open Source is a public Repository but its a renowned project
    --> Linux --> Contributors are also public
    --> Watchers are also public -- readonly 
    --> if Watchers want to use your code in any ways then 

--> Watchers can clone the code and update the code based on their requirements
--> Before using the cloned project for commercial purposes then u have to take an agreement or legal consent from the authors of the projects if the projects license has the rule

Stars --> Subscription, Bookmarking



Version Control System (VCS) --> BitBucket, GitLab

--> Branches & Forks

---> Same Repository can have multiple branches
---> Individual developer will do branching to keep his code versioned
    ---> main -- branch --> Minimum Viable Product -(MVP) v0-> v
    ---> clone -- dev --> Feature ehancement or code updated or commenting code  and test
    ---> branch names ==> main, dev, stage, qa, prod
    ---> dev --> main merge code ---> Branch merging



---> Forking is to handle multiple developers for single main repository
---> Multiple developers 
---> LMS  releasable project 
    ---> Main Repositiroy --> main, dev, stage, qa, prod
    ---> All developers should fork the project and develop individually and merge in the main repositor



1. Created a repository in Github
2. Cloned that repository into our local machine
3. We copied our Project files to the repository that we have clone
4. Project folder (Git repository) --> At the time of clone --> state 1
5. You have changed state of the repository to state2
6. BY adding new afiles and modifying the readme
7. Local github repository(Project folder) has local changes
8. git status -- commands
    --> what you have done to your repository
    --> Already existed file readme.. --> you have modified
    --> Also you have added new files

9. you have to add the local changes to stage --> storing -- inmtermediate --save the state
10. -- command for staging your local changes is --> git add file1 file2 file3
    -- git add . --> all changes

10. final-fix --> Commiting changes 
    -- git commit -m "I have added new code to the project"

11. commit will happen locally

12. If you want sync with GitHub Central repository
    -- git push origin main


--- DEVELOPMENT

1. new branch creation for the repositor
2. git branch dev
3. git checkout dev
4. changes to the code
5. git add
6. git commit 
7. git push origin dev
