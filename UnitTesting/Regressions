UnitTesting --> Test the code with test cases
LMS --> check_authentication --> Test cases
    1. Success Test cases
        1. user, password ==> THARUN, Tharun123
        2. user, password ==> PRAKASH. Prakash123
    2. Unsuccessful Test cases
        1. user, password ==> THARUN, Tharun1234


you can reorganize the code and maintain the quality

Code Coverage --> How much the code lines covered while testing

only one test case --> 6/16 ==> 37% (THARUN, Tharun123)
test case 2 (PRAKAS,Prakash123) ==> 37%

testcase 3 --> Tharun, Tharun1234 with correct password in 2 iteration ===> 95

testcase 3 --> Tharun, Tharun1234 --> 2 chances --> wrong password == 100%



THRESHOLD --> 90%


Mock Testing --> Mocking 3rd Party Libraries

example: --> AWS librariies

--> To Test AWS involved code we need AWS accountID, Secret Key and it involves cost
--> We will take a mocking library which mocks or acts like AWS so that we can feel the testing
