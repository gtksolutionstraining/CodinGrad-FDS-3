OOP: Object Oriented Programming

---> Its programming style which will make your software more scalable,maintainable, extendable, operatable, organized, memory efficient.
---> It can also be used to design few well known pattern followed by many industrial projects.

OOPs: Its programming style works around the Objects instead functions as in Functional Programming Style.

Object: An object is a real world entity

Class: A description of related entites which have certain actions and certain properties.

Class: A blueprint or logical entity
Object: An instance of class or physical entity

Parrot --> Class --> Description of what is parrot, what a parrot will have, what a parrot will do 
Parrot --> Example --> Physical entity

Class: Its a collection of actions and properties


----> Actions ==> Member Methods / Member Functions
----> Properties ==> Attributes / Feature / Variables


Class is a collection of member functions and member variables

===========================================================================================================================

Rules:
1. Class Name should be starts with Capital letter


---> Object State (Initial): An Object state is when an object is created what properties it has. That particular state is called Object State.

---> Object state will change through the actions(member functions) that the object is doing
---> Without constructor object will be created with no state
---> With Constructor and with no arguments --> Object will be created but the initial state of all objects is same
---> With Constructor and with arguments --> Objects will be created with different initial states.
---> With Constructor and with arguments but the arguments are again objects of the same class --> Copy Constructor.
---> Constructor Overloading --> CPP, supported. in Python not supported
---> But If we write constructors in the class code then the last constructor is valid. all others are invalid
---> Method Overloading --> CPP Supported and Python Doesn't support
---> But If we write same methods in the class code then the last method is valid. all others are invalid
---> Destructor ---> CPP Supported and python doesn't
---> Memory management and Garbage Collection

---> Member Operator (., ->)
---> In CPP (.) --> Static Membership Operator
---> In CPP (->) --> Dynamic Membership Operator --> Pointer Membership Operator --> Used mostly memory management
---> In Python (.) ---> Membership Operator
===========================================================================================================================

Properties:

    1. Class Variables -- Class Variables are shared variables for all of the objects
    2. Instance Variables -- Object -- Instance Variables are closed properties of individual objects


--> Parrot -- logical entity
    Count of physical enties
    count property ---> shared property / class variable

---> Objects
    1. parrot1 --> legs, eyes, wings, mouth --- instance properties
    2. parrot2


---> self is python keyword
---> self is used as a parameter in member methods inside class
---> self is always should be at the starting position of the function arguments
---> self is a memory location of an object
---> If you provide self in method of a class then it is called instance method
---> If you don't provide self in method of a class then it is called static method
---> cls is python keyword
---> cls is used in parameter in member methods 
---> If you want to provide cls, then it should be first of the function
---> If you provide cls you should not provide self
---> If you provide cls in function arugments then it is called class method



Properties:

    1. Class Properties
    2. Instance Properties

Methods:
    1. Instance methods
    2. Static Methods
    3. Class Methods

Access Specifiers:
    1. Public
    2. Private
    3. Protected


Inheritance
Polymorphism
1. Static Poly Morphism --> Method Overloading
2. Dynamic Poly Morphism --> Method Overriding



ENCAPSULATION: Binding data and function --> Binding Member variables and member methods inside the class
Object Binding ==> 


Instance initial object state properties (Default State of an object): The properties which have been created using self in the constructor
Next state instance properties: The properties which have been activate by calling instance methods which have their definition.

Garbage Collector ==> Software program (daemon) --> Java Programming Language

Garbage Collector programs should be written by developers in CPP

Garbage Collector has to be written by developers in machine critical projects


Local Scope and Global Scope


--> When you access any property or a method then the object will look for that property or method inside its location (Local scope). If not found in local scope then it search in global scope


ABSTRACTION ==> Hiding implementation details


OOPS Properties:
1. Class
2. Object
3. Abstraction
4. Encapsulation
5. Inheritance
6. Polymorphism
7. Access Specifiers
