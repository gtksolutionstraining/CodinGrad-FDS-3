Design the Solution:
==> Programming pardigms

Code design --> should be scalable and maintanable, easy understood, well documented, Open For extension and closed for modification and developer friendly.

1. Functional Programming
--> Software should be breaked into functional modules --> Functions
--> Advantages:Very Easy, Developer friendly,  Easily understood, Maintainable
--> Disadvantages: Cannot be scaled.
--> Is mostly used in React --> Frontend
2. Declerative Programming
--> is mostly used in Terrarform, AWS CDK --> DevOps 
--> you declare the work then programming language will execute in order
3. Object Oriented Programming --> OOPS
--> Software should be breaked into objects --> Data
--> Advantages: It is scalable, Open for extension and closed for modification
--> Disadvantage:  Designing solution, Maintainance, Hard to implement, hard understanding
--> Is mostly used in Python, Django, Tensorflow, --> Backend
