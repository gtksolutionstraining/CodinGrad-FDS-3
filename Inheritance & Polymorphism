Inheritance --> Adopting base details and implementing new details

---> UtilitySoftware  ---> can be used by many other softwares MainSoftware


Inheritance ===> All Protected properties and All Protected member methods and public properties and public methods can be accessed by inherited class

Protected properties can be accessed in same file.


---> Base class/Parent class
---> Child class

Data Perspective --> Properties
---> Object creation is normal in Base class
---> object creation in child class 
    1. Object reference will be created in memory--> address will be passed to self keyword in constructor
    2. super().__init__() --> This will call base class constructor with self reference as a parameter --> public and protected propeties will be created in child class object's memory location
    3. child class constructor will start executing


Method Percpetive --> Encapuslation
--> Inherited Object will have
    1. Local Class Scope
    2. Base Class Scope


PolyMorhism ==> based on input object can be in different object states

--> poly --> many
--> morph --> shape

---> Method Resolution Order (MRO)
-----> In instance of time an object will be in only one object state --> Even the object has many scopes which are from its parent classes 

--> An Object can have multiple states w.r.t to inherited classe --> PolyMorphism
--> But an object must and should exist in only one state.
---> TO make sure that the polymorphed object to be existed in only one state we use MRO

---> MRO ---> 
    Order of states of an object in many states
    1. Local Scope
    --> Multiple Inheritance
    2. First Inherited
    3. Second Inherited
    4. Multilevel Inherited
    5. Hierarchial Inheritance
